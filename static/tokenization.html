<h3>Tokenization</h3>

Our tokenization is fairly simple (based on the Penn Treebank standard):

<ul>
<li>most punctuation is split from adjoining words
<li>double quotes (<code>"</code>) are changed to doubled single
     forward- and backward- quotes (<code>``</code> and
     <code>''</code>)
<li>verb contractions and the Anglo-Saxon genitive of nouns
     are split into their component morphemes, and each morpheme is tagged
     separately.
     <ul>
       <li>Examples
	    <samp>
	    <ul>
	      <li> children's --> children 's
	      <li> parents' --> parents '
	      <li> won't --> wo n't
	      <li> gonna --> gon na
	      <li> I'm --> I 'm
	    </ul>
	    </samp>
     </ul>
     This tokenization allows us to analyze each component
     separately, so (for example) "I" can be in the subject Noun
     Phrase while "'m" is the head of the main verb phrase.
<li>There are some subtleties for hyphens vs. dashes, elipsis dots (...)  and
     so on, but these often depend on the particular corpus or application
     of the tagged data.
</ul>
